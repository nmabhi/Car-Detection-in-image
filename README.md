Car-detector
============

Primarily used on a self localizing bot to detect cars, if any, in its path.
Achieved an accuracy of around 90% on provided testData while using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).
The accuracy will improve drastically as we improve the negative image deataset by adding more negative imgaes.

Ongoing

Currently working on methods to improve accuracy through feedback from humans.
